# Bridging Bitcoin
#### November 21, 2021
For the most part, bridging bitcoin will require tokenizing it in some form. The most common "wrapped" form of bitcoin is WBTC, (announced in late 2018)[https://blog.bitgo.com/introducing-wbtc-the-power-of-bitcoin-with-the-flexibility-of-erc20-48c6681a9a7c] and (more formally launched in early 2019)[https://blog.bitgo.com/wrapped-btc-launches-with-bitgo-custody-and-full-proof-of-assets-c7fbf21e4a66].

Generally speaking, I would personally recommend the usage of WBTC. Anecdotally, it's the quickest and most commonly adopted wrapped form of BTC. One caveat, however, is that it is centralized: it relies on a centralized entity (custodian) that is responsible for issuance and burns.
