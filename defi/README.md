# DEFI
## Dex (decentralized exchange)
The backbone of any defi ecosystem, dexes have been able to reach their current status today (in terms of usage) thanks to net-new products like AMMs, with Uniswap leading the way. Since the advent of AMMs, different variants (e.g. with more than just 2 assets in a liquidity pool) have reached the market, and achieved product-market fit.

There are two particular subtypes:
- Constant product pools
- Stableswap pools
- Note: Astroport's docs have a great [primer](https://docs.astroport.fi/astroport/astroport/astro-pools) that walks through these types in detail

Notable examples:
- Uniswap (and its many clones on other EVM networks)
- Astroport: notable for many reasons, particularly with regards to its highly anticipated launch, attracting ~$1.2b of initial TVL along the way.
- Balancer
- Curve

## Case studies
### Astroport
Astroport has arguably been Terra's flagship defi product launch thus far. Protocols like Anchor have launched in the past and have been a crucial part of the ecosystem overall, but in terms of mindshare and anticipation, Astroport's definitely up there. 

Currently, their docs are pretty sparse but there are a few standout features:
- A rather novel lockdrop mechanism to invite initial liquidity before launch
- Delphi published a [writeup](https://members.delphidigital.io/reports/introducing-lockdrop-lba-a-novel-token-launch-mechanism/) on the lockdrop mechanism; it's clear that Delphi has played a large part in
